Total Acres vs Tillable Acres: Logic and UI Explanation
Our LandIQ platform uses a sophisticated two-tier acreage system designed for practical agricultural land valuation. Here's how it works:

The Logic Behind Total vs Tillable Acres
Total Acreage (acreage field):

Represents the entire property size including all land types
Used for overall property boundaries and legal descriptions
Includes tillable cropland, non-tillable areas, farmsteads, roads, waterways, etc.
Tillable Acres (tillableAcres field):

Represents only the land suitable for crop production
Critical for CSR2 calculations since CSR2 only applies to cropland
Affects the precision of soil-based valuations
Typically 85-95% of total acreage on most Iowa farms
How the UI Works
Property Form Interface:

Side-by-side input fields in a responsive grid layout
Total Acreage field (left) - labeled "Total Acreage" with decimal input
Tillable Acres field (right) - labeled "Tillable Acres" with placeholder "e.g. 152"
Smart validation - tillable acres cannot exceed total acres
Mobile-responsive - stacks vertically on smaller screens
User Experience Flow:

Farmers input total property size first (familiar concept)
Then specify tillable portion (what they actually farm)
Clear visual separation with distinct labels
Intuitive number inputs with decimal support
Valuation Logic Implementation
CSR2 Calculations:

// CSR2 value applies only to tillable acres
const csr2Value = csr2Rating * dollarPerPoint; // Per acre for tillable land
const totalCroplandValue = csr2Value * tillableAcres;
const nonTillableValue = baseValue * (totalAcres - tillableAcres);
Smart Valuation Strategy:

When CSR2 data is available: Use CSR2 × $/point for tillable acres, base county value for non-tillable
When no CSR2 data: Apply county base value uniformly across all acres
Blended approach: Weighted average based on tillable vs non-tillable portions
Example Calculation:

Total: 160 acres, Tillable: 155 acres
CSR2: 85 rating at $185/point = $15,725/acre for tillable land
Non-tillable: 5 acres at county base value
Result: Precision valuation reflecting actual farming capability
Display in Reports
Valuation Breakdown shows:

CSR2 value prominently highlighted when available
Clear distinction between land value and total property value
Tillable acres factored into CSR2 calculations
Non-tillable areas valued at county base rates
This two-tier system provides the precision that agricultural professionals need while maintaining simplicity for farmers entering property data. The UI guides users naturally through the process while the backend applies sophisticated valuation logic based on actual farming potential.
