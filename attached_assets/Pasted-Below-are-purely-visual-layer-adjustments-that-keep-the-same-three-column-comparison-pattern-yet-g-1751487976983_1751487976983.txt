Below are purely visual-layer adjustments that keep the same three-column “comparison” pattern yet give the module a more polished, data-centric feel. None of these touch your calculation logic or component structure—only the styling and micro-interactions.

1. Strengthen the Visual Hierarchy
Element	Current	Adjustment	Why
Section title (“Valuation Approaches Comparison”)	Same size weight as card titles	Bump to text-lg font-semibold and add a subtle divider line under it	Anchors the eye before scanning the three cards
Per-Acre Value vs. Total Property Value	Similar color/size, competes	Keep Per-Acre light-weight (text-sm font-medium text-muted-foreground), but push Total to text-2xl font-bold with a deeper brand color	Reinforces which number matters most

2. Unify Card Anatomy
Padding & Radius

Move to a consistent p-6 (desktop) / p-4 (mobile) with rounded-2xl.

Add a soft ring-1 ring-border/15 around each card to separate them gently from the white canvas.

Iconography

Swap the generic emojis for outline icons from lucide-react (e.g., Activity, TrendingUp, Bot).

Place inside a w-9 h-9 rounded-full bg-muted flex items-center justify-center halo to keep weights consistent.

Stateful Colors

CSR2 (soil) → brand-green

Income → brand-blue

AI Market-Adj → brand-purple

Use these only on the icons and the Total value chip to avoid rainbow overload.

3. Micro-interactions
Interaction	Detail	Effect
Hover Elevation	hover:shadow-lg hover:-translate-y-0.5 transition	Adds depth without changing layout
Tooltip on Total Value	Explain calculation basis (“Acre × Parcel Acres”)	Educates users in-context
Confidence Score	Replace the “8.0/10” pill with a thin progress bar (w-full h-2 rounded bg-muted) filled to 80 % in brand-indigo	Visual cognition beats reading numbers

4. Typography & Spacing Tweaks

- $13,276/acre
+ <span class="text-xl font-semibold">$13,276</span>
+ <span class="text-sm text-muted-foreground">per acre</span>
Tighten vertical gaps to space-y-3 inside cards.

Ensure numbers align on the same baseline across columns; it prevents micro-jitters when users scan left-to-right.

5. Subtle Motion on Load
Use framer-motion to fade-in cards with a 40 ms stagger:

<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 8 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  transition={{ duration: .35, delay: i * .04 }}
>
  {/* Card content */}
</motion.div>
Creates perceived performance and polish.

6. Optional Dark-Mode Readiness
Base all colors on Tailwind’s semantic tokens (bg-card, text-primary, etc.).

Provide dark:bg-card/70 and dark:ring-border/25 to keep contrast ratios in black themes.

7. Quick Tailwind Skeleton (illustrative)

  <div className="flex items-center gap-3">

    <h3 className="text-base font-medium">CSR2 Quantitative</h3>
  </div>

  <div className="space-y-1">
    <div className="text-xl font-semibold">$13,276 <span className="text-sm font-medium text-muted-foreground">/acre</span></div>
    <Chip color="green">$3,053,526</Chip>
  </div>

  <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">Based on soil productivity</p>
</Card>
Final Thought
These refinements keep the “three cards + confidence score” concept intact but give each metric clearer prominence, build brand consistency, and add just enough delight to feel enterprise-ready. Let me know if you’d like the full React/Tailwind component refactored or a quick Figma mockup to plug into your design system.
